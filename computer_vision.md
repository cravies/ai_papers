## DINO [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14294]
* DINO: self-**di**stillation with **no** labels
* Facebook trained a vision transformer backbone with self supervised learning
  * reminder: unsupervised learning (e.g clustering) is about learning patterns in the data without a predefined task
  * self supervised learning however is a form of supervised learning where the labels are generated from the data itself (i.e no human labelling needed)
* TODO...
